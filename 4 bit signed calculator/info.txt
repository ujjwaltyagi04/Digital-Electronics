 I have completed designing of 4 bit signed calculator using Xilinx Design Suite 14.7.

[M1] [M0] - are for selecting the operation to be performed
 0 0 - Addition
 0 1 - Substraction
 1 0 - Multiplication
 1 1 - Division

A & B are the 4-bit inputs.
[S1] [S0] - decide the polarity of the inputs (i.e. negative or positive), 0- positive & 1- negative.
